# oop-python-basics

This repository is created for learning and practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **Python**.  
It includes beginner-friendly examples, notes, and mini projects that demonstrate key OOP concepts like:

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism  

The goal is to build a solid foundation in OOP using hands-on Python code.
